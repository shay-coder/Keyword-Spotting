# TinyMLKit Projectâ€”Building a Voice Command control of Screen using Keyword Spotting

Edge Impulse gives programmers the tools they need to build the next wave of embedded machine learning solutions for intelligent devices.
See here for instructions how to burn code of keyword spotting to distinguish auditory events, particularly your speech, even when there is background chatter or other noise.  Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is a tiny development board with a Cortex-M4 microcontroller,

# Requirements
Hardware

    Arduino ble 33 based development boards,Tiny MLKit 

Tools

     Edge Impulse
     Arduino IDE
     Jupyter Notebook

# Connecting to Edge Impulse

Here is link of video hpw to connect edge impulse with your device

https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/development-platforms/officially-supported-mcu-targets/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense#connecting-to-edge-impulse

To set this device up in Edge Impulse, you will need to install the following software:

1- Edge Impulse CLI

2- Arduino CLI


https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/128033/deployment

# Serial connection

Open Arduino IDE

Sketch-> Include Libraray -> Add Zip file
Then, goto
File-> Examples -> "Your_project_name -> nano_ble33_ense_microphone

Do some chnages arduino code is given in above fies

Use screen or Serial monitor in Arduino IDE to set up a serial connection over USB.

# Burn the Code

Upload the code on your kit select your serial port
After uploading open python code set the respective port no and run the task now you can see your project working!
